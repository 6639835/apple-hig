# **Rating indicators**

A rating indicator uses a series of horizontally arranged graphical symbols — by default, stars — to communicate a ranking level.

A rating indicator doesn't display partial symbols; it rounds the value to display complete symbols only. Within a rating indicator, symbols are always the same distance apart and don't expand or shrink to fit the component's width.

## **Best [practices](#page-0-0)**

**Make it easy to change rankings.** When presenting a list of ranked items, let people adjust the rank of individual items inline without navigating to a separate editing screen.

**If you replace the star with a custom symbol, make sure that its purpose is clear.** The star is a very recognizable ranking symbol, and people may not associate other symbols with a rating scale.

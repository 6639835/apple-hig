## **Learn the building blocks of design**

Design is where everything starts. It's not just how people view your app, but also how they interact with it. Design drives people's experiences, impressions, and feelings. And it can express core truths about how we process information, make decisions, and interact with the world around us.

<span id="page-0-0"></span>Start your design path by peeking behind the curtain of Apple's design principles in these video sessions from Apple designers and evangelists. You'll find out how Apple team members and the developer community get inspired, learn how to create welcoming, empowering, and gratifying user experiences, and find ways to simplify your navigation without compromising personality.

## <span id="page-1-0"></span>**Interface with the HIG**

When you're ready to dive deeper into design, the Human Interface [Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) (HIG) will be your best friend. The HIG is the home for guidance and best practices for Apple platforms, a comprehensive resource that you'll rely on from first sketch to final pixel. We'll be honest: It's pretty big. But we encourage you to get started by exploring these introductory pages. From there, you can gradually begin to branch out and see where your work takes you.

## **Assemble your toolbox**

Like all craftspeople, good designers need proper tools. Your list of equipment begins with the Apple Design Resources, the building blocks of Apple design. The Apple Design Resources include the fonts, icons, product bezels, and other materials you'll need to get started, as well as design templates for Figma, Sketch, Photoshop, and Keynote. You'll also want to explore SF Symbols, a library of more than 6,000 symbols that integrate seamlessly with Apple platforms.

Prototyping is the art of generating, testing, and validating new ideas. Start by setting aside a few hours for a tutorial that walks you through the basics of the prototyping process. To get a little more insight into the process — and travel back in time — check out a vintage but timeless video about what prototyping can mean in practice.

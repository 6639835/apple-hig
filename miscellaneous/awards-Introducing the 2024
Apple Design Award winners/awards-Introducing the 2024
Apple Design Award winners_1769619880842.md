App | iPhone, iPad, Mac

Journaling apps just don't get much cuter than *Bears Gratitude*, a warm and welcoming way to establish — and, just as crucially, maintain — a daily gratitude practice. Yes, the bears and other characters are superhuggable and turn up in delightfully unexpected places. But they also serve as a welcoming way into the content. And with its thoughtfully considered touchpoints, *Bears Gratitude* is a simple way to encourage and embrace honest self-reflection.

#### **NYT Games**

The New York Times Company, USA

Game | iPhone, iPad

An all-time great with a compelling mix of games and the source of the fierce debate, "What's the best Wordle starting word?" In the past year, NYT Games evolved well past its classic crosswords and breakout s-mas-h to redesign its navigation, expand its already diverse catalog of games, and introduce grabby new conversation starters like Connections — which, like Wordle, feels perfectly calibrated for maximum replayability.

#### **Procreate Dreams**

Savage Interactive Pty Ltd, Australia

The new standard in creating 2D animations on iPad. *Procreate Dreams* is a marvelously designed tool that allows creatives of all kinds to animate using the extensive and familiar library of brushes, gestures, and PencilKit-enabled behaviors from the original *Procreate*. Its controls are effortlessly intuitive — multitouch interactions and Apple Pencil are both supported — so it's easy to jump right in, whether you're a career animator or brand new to the medium. As is the case with its predecessor, every interaction in *Procreate Dreams* feels polished, thoughtfully considered, and ready to use out of the box. If you're looking to explore animation, it's a dream come true.

**Lost in Play** 

Happy Juice Games, Israel

Game | iPhone, iPad, Apple Vision Pro

Lost in Play feels like a graphic novel come to life. Every corner of its inventive world — from its spooky forest to its clifftop village — brims with visual imagination and handcrafted charm. And the game is filled with endearing characters (like a surprisingly snarky flock of sheep) and fun mini-games. Add in easy-to-learn interactions and compelling gameplay, and you've got a game worth getting lost in.

### Crouton

Devin Davies, New Zealand

App | iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple Vision Pro

Recipe apps rise and fall on their organization and information hierarchy, and *Crouton* serves up a clean, tasty interface for stashing away recipes, creating grocery lists, and presenting step-by-step instructions in the kitchen — even if you're not exactly a chef. Everything in *Crouton*, from the next recipe step to the name of that missing spice, is easy to find and right where you need it. And its effortless series of interactions mean people can keep their focus on the counter rather than their screen.

### Rytmos

Floppy Club ApS, Denmark

Game | iPhone, iPad

A world music-inspired rhythm game that looks as good as it sounds. *Rytmos* challenges players to solve puzzles by creating pathways using simple drag gestures, and every completed level adds a new element to an evolving song.

### **Gentler Streak Fitness Tracker**

Gentler Stories d.o.o., Slovenia

App | iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch

With its thoughtful focus on both physical and mental health, *Gentler Streak* is chasing the elusive goal of improving everyone's lifestyles, no

matter who or where they are. As its name suggests, the app is powered not by insistent reminders but an optimistic and encouraging vibe that takes into account not just physical fitness but mental wellbeing too. To make sure people focus on those goals, *Gentler Streak* relies on a subtle and consistently pleasing design language. Its health data is smartly organized, and its Monthly Summary view — which shows how you're doing in relation to your history — is less about hard comparisons and more about progress.

![](_page_6_Picture_1.jpeg)

The Wreck
The Pixel Hunt, France

Game | iPhone, iPad

A lush visual novel about sisterhood, motherhood, grief, and survival. *The Wreck* tells the story of Junon, a writer who's abruptly called to a hospital to make a life-changing decision. The story is far from light, but it's beautifully written and eloquently told, especially through fleeting thought bubbles that reflect the swirl and scatter of stressful situations. *The Wreck* may be filed under games, but it's also a powerful, heartbreaking story, one that invites players to think about their own choices as well.

Rooms
Things Inc., USA

App | iPhone, iPad

An incredible canvas for creativity, set in a nostalgic 8-bit world. *Rooms* is tough to categorize: It's a blank slate for building imaginative scenes, a platform for cozy gaming, and a social space that lets you interact with thousands of other people's creations. Rooms in *Rooms* are lovingly rendered and sprinkled with tons of delightful detail, and the app's interactions, sounds, and throwback visuals strike the perfect balance between quirky and compelling. Quirky, compelling, and executed with a delightful retro twist.

Lies of P

NEOWIZ Corporation, South Korea

Game | Mac

A technical showpiece for Mac — and a dark, fascinating twist on a familiar tale. In this gorgeously rendered adventure, players control a robotic puppet created by Geppetto — yes, that Geppetto — who must survive a battle march through a burned-out city to find his maker. One look at the visuals reveals a world of beautiful textures, detailed lighting, and stunning effects — and visual customization options like MetalFX Upscaling and volumetric fog effects let you style the ruined city to your liking. Add a coldly beautiful soundtrack and the nostalgic shadow of the original story, and you get a complete, considered, and unique experience — and that's the truth.

### djay

Algoriddim GmbH, Germany

The app spins up high-quality turntables that you can scratch to your heart's content, a cool interactive effects panel, and an array of magnificently considered environments, like the space lounge populated by dancing robots. djay pro set out to create the "flow state" sought by live DJs on the spatial canvas; they've come away with a smash hit.

#### **Blackbox**

Shapes and Stories, USA

Game | Apple Vision Pro

Blackbox on iOS challenged players to think outside the screen; Blackbox on visionOS challenges them to think about every (metaphorical) corner of the spatial canvas from its very first moments. Revealing too much about Blackbox would spoil its many surprises; suffice it to say that wonderful details abound — like the soapy floating bubbles that drive level selection.

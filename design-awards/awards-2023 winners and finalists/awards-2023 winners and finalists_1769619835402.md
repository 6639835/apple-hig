## **Resident Evil Village**

**CAPCOM Co., Ltd.**

*Resident Evil Village* is an absolute powerhouse and the new standard of Mac gaming.

From its creepy castle to its decrepit factories to its magnificently hideous villains, *Resident Evil Village* offers some of the most realistic graphics ever seen on Apple

devices. (Players can enable the MetalFX Upscaling feature to make being hunted by monsters extra terrifying.) It's an incredible example of what Mac games can be.

By using the combined powers of AI and Neural Engine, *SwingVision* serves as a tennis coach that can help with every aspect of your game.

**GAME**

## **MARVEL SNAP**

#### **Second Dinner**

*MARVEL SNAP* has it all: brisk gameplay, unbelievable artwork, and an incredible stickiness that keeps you coming back — and rewards you for doing so. But the game's true innovation is its "snap" mechanic, which instantly doubles the stakes and introduces whole new layers of strategy and good old-fashioned psychological warfare. The game is a visual feast, awash in 3D parallax graphics, astonishing animations (just watch Hulk smash in 60 fps), and delightfully deployed haptics. True Marvel believers will be rewarded by a bottomless array of variants and deep-cut characters, while newbies will pick it up in no time at all. *MARVEL SNAP* is an incredible achievement that's redefined the collectible-card-game genre.
